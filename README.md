Gains Tracker is an online workout tracking tool. It can log workouts, view previous workouts, keep track of personal bests, set and view fitness goals, and provide graphics based on your workout progress. The demographic is anyone 14 years old or older and is interested in their health and fitness. This tool is geared toward weight-lifting/strength training workouts.

This web app was created for my final project for my Advanced Web Design class.

This page goes more in depth about the purpose of Gains Tracker.

Log workouts:
Users’ can log their workouts in the gym. They have to input a workout type (upper body, lower body, or full body) date, start time, end time, and location for each. There is an option to add cardio which requires input of cardio type (running, walking, cycling, swimming, and elliptical), distance, and duration. Lastly, you add your exercises to the workout. You must have at least one exercise to record a workout. When the user clicks the “+ Exercise” button, a modal will pop up with an exercise form with the required inputs: name, muscle, weight, repetitions, and sets. 

View Workouts:
Users’ can view their previous workouts. On the page, there will be a list of workouts that show their workout type, date, start time,  duration, and location. There is a “view” button for each workout where you can see all of the data from that workout including the list of exercises, and cardio information if cardio was part of that workout. 

Personal Bests:
Users’ can view their PB’s (Personal Bests) for each cardio type and each exercise that they  have at least one record of from their previous workouts. For cardio, it will display the longest in distance (km) and longest in duration (hours). For exercises, it will display the heaviest weight (lbs) used for that exercise.

Workout progress:
Users’ can view a couple graphics based on their previous workouts. The first graphic is a pie chart of workout types that they have done in the last 30 days. This is important information to have to ensure the user has been working out all muscle groups evenly, or to make sure they are staying on true to their routine by hitting certain muscle groups. The second graphic is a bar graph that keeps track of the weekly amount of workouts in the last 10 weeks. This is another important graphic to have to ensure the user is being consistent with working out.

Set and View Goals:
Users’ can set and view any goals they would like. There’s no restrictions to what type of goals to be set, but it is best for the goals to be fitness and wellness oriented. For example, I want to workout 3 days a week. To set a goal, a user will have to enter a goal name and description.
